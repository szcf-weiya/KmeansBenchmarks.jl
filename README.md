# KmeansBenchmarks.jl

[![CI](https://github.com/szcf-weiya/KmeansBenchmarks.jl/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/szcf-weiya/KmeansBenchmarks.jl/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This project seeks to systematically benchmark and compare k-means implementations across the following aspects:

- **Software ecosystem**: R (e.g., `stats`, `ClusterR`) vs Julia (e.g., `Clustering`)
- **Algorithm variants**: Variants like Lloydâ€™s, Hartigan-Wong
- **Initialization**: Random seeding, k-means++

We evaluate the performance from three main metrics:

- Clustering accuracy
- Ratio of the Between-sum-of-squares / Total-sum-of-squares
- Computational time

This work aims to provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners in selecting optimal k-means configurations tailored to their data size, dimensionality, and domain requirements.
